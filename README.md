This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.



### `Initial Plan`

- Create a home page. Inside, you will have a carosel of 3 cards displaying the profiles.<br />
- Each account will consist of 3 parts:<br />
    1- Profile info with the username and photo on the left side.<br />
    2- Navigation bar at the top.<br />
    3- Photo grid in the main body.<br />

- When the user is logged in & out. Code it in the state (start with the false).<br />


### `Big Ideas`

Would love to implement the following:<br />
1- FileStack so the user can upload photos and implemet Axios. (https://www.filestack.com/)<br />
2- would love to have a form for logging in and validation (want to use Formik).<br />
3- Redux would be useful and beautiful for the app.<br />
4- A local json host to save the data and change it.<br />

### `Wireframe`
